# Welcome to my profile

## About me
I'm a student on a Software Engineering degree that wants to specialize on cybersecurity.

## Aims
I want to work in the cyber-security field.


## Focuses
Right now, I'm focused on finishing my Software Engineering degree. That is, learning *Python*, *Java*, *Verilog* and *R*.
I'm also developing some other skills by myself, such as learning about *Linux* systems, *Bash*, and how to use tools like *Git*.

On the other hand, to learn more about web security, I'm working on completing the *The Odin Project* curriculum *(HTML, CSS and JS)*.
Once I finish it, I plan to learn about web hacking using *Hacker101* as my main resource, also completing the *CTFs* that are included in this resource on the way.
